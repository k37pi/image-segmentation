# image-segmentation
APMA 935 Assignment 2

cv.m contains code to perform image segmentation (Active contours without edges by Chan and Vese, https://www.math.ucla.edu/~lvese/PAPERS/IEEEIP2001.pdf)

The code allows you to choose between 2 types of initial contours (single circle/rectangle and many circles at once, radius input required). 
There is also a choice for Heaviside functions and whether to use the delta function or not.
